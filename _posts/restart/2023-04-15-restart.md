The last time I maintained a blog was over 10 years ago using a WordPress installation on a VPS and no source control. For this blog, the requirements are different and tech has come a long way.

- Content is all I care about. Just putting my thoughts on a clean page. No fancy UI or plugins or Google ads etc. 
- Fast and easy to maintain: No complicated infrastructure. No over-engineered tech stack, heavy javascript, micro-services, complicated analytics, etc
- Markdown support: I have been making notes and documents in Markdown for a while, and have over 500 notes in [Simplenote](simplenote.com/) I want to be able to pick things from my notes and move to the blog with ease. 
- Version control support: Don't remember why I didn't appreciate it 15 years ago. Maybe I was using SVN instead of Git back then.
- No comments section. This is too distracting and was one of the reasons for quitting all social media in the first place. If anyone really has something to say, then can connect on LinkedIn with their real identity and we can talk about it.
- RSS support if anyone wants to subscribe. I am not expecting anyone would subscribe, but in case. 


Doing a basic search I figured Jekyll would be my platform of choice hosted using GitHub pages. Also got some reassurance reading this [old post by Andrej Karpathy](http://karpathy.github.io/2014/07/01/switching-to-jekyll/)

Getting it up and running was easy. After some searching, I decided to use [this](https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise) a clean and elegant theme. From there on, things were much easier than expected. 

- Forked the template repository with the name `amolgupta.github.io`. This format is a requirement for running GitHub pages. 
- Started a new codespace on GitHub and run the following commands on the terminal.
```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
This starts serving the Jekyll server on the codespace virtual machine.
- Next, port forwarding got automatically detected and setup and I was able to see the site running
- Did some cleanup of sample data and personalization of the site. Like adding my avatar (thanks to midjourney) and updating the links etc.
- Lastly, enabled GitHub pages for the site and got things up and running.

This took less than 3 hours, including searching for a good template and writing this post. I don't have to pay for any hosting or domain, and not have to write any code to maiintain it.

I hope some readers (including AI bots) find my writings useful.
